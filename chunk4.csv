183,12947, mRNA leaves the nucleus  The mRNA strand is decoded and turned into a second code  That code is then decoded and turned into protein,1
184,12948,The protein gets packaged up into little groups. The protein is sent to another part of the cell.,0
185,12949, The cell makes messenger RNA.  The mRNA changes to tRNA.  The cell sends the tRNA out of the cell into the cytoplasm.  The tRNA goes into the ribosomes where protein will be created.,0
186,12950,"First, the proteins are removed and the ribosomes do something to them.",0
187,12951, The protein starts to develop.   The protein starts to expand.   The protein is starting to move around in the cell.    The protein is starting to go through interphase and reproduce.,0

200,12964,The first step to protein synthesis is mRNA leaves the cell. The second step is it gets more protein. The third step is it brings the protein back for the cell. The last step on protein mRNA is it puts the protein back into the cell for it to function.,0
201,12965,"When mRNA is leaving the nucleus it is involved in four major steps.  Prophase, Interphase, Metaphase and  Anaphase. These are the four major steps involved in protein synthesis.",0
202,12966,"Metaphase, antiphase, telophase, and interphase",0
203,12967,The first step is getting the protein. The second step is taking it in. The third step is getting it processed. The fourth is using it because you need to use protein for the body and it helps the body also when mRNA leave the nucleus.,0
204,12968,"RNA multiplies, meaning that there are twice as much RNA for the cell. The mRNA goes back into the nucleus, the mRNA returns with more RNA. The protein synthesis is made by the Mitochondria. Also, the proteins go back to the nucleus.",0

208,12972," mRNA leaves the nucleus, and goes to where the DNA is located.   mRNA drops off the codons of RNA   mRNA leaves and goes back to get more codons   the process starts again",0
209,12973,mitochondria getting the code for protein synthesis,0
210,12974,When mRNA leaves the nucleus a ribosome latches onto the mRNA and takes the instructions it needs off of the mRNA.,1
211,12975,DNA Reproduction,0
212,12976,THE MRNA CARRIES THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS TO THE GOLGI APPARATUS  THERE THE PROTEIN IS SYNTHESIZED. THE TRNA THEN TRANSPORTS THE PROTEIN TO THE RIBOSOME. THE TRNA CARRIES A CODON WHICH STAYS ATTACHED TO THE PROTEIN. THIS COND HELP IT ATTACH TO A SPECIFIC ENZYME,0
213,12977,once the rna leaves the nucleus it travels to the tell the ribosomes that it is ready to make a new copy of itself so that the proteins that are needed can go to where they belong. they make the proteins and then go back into the nucleus and break down,0
214,12978,mRNA RNA DNA tRNA,0
215,12979,The RNA is replicated and codons and amino acids exchanged and changed into amino acids for DNA.,0
216,12980,mRNA gives the genetic information to DNA. The DNA copies the information through a process of replication. The DNA uses the codons to reveal the amino acids to make a polypeptide chain. The chain moves throughout the cell and creates more proteins.,0
217,12981,"Translation, tRNA, Reflection, and DNA",0
218,12982,"First off, the mRNA Separates the links in the DNA strand. Secondly, the strand goes to a ribosome Which makes it into rRNA. Thirdly, it is taken to something and made into tRNA.",0
219,12983,"When mRNA leaves the nucleus, the next four major steps involved in protein synthesis are, mRNA leaves and travels to the cytoplasm and onto a chromosome. After that it turns into tRNA. When it turns into tRNA it turns into protein.",0
220,12984,"tRNA, rRNA,",0
221,12985,The DNA has to translate to mRNA. For example TAG would become AUC. It then matches with nucleotides to form bonds. These longs strands make sequences. The sequences are instructed to make proteins.,0

224,12988,The mRNA travels to the ribosome and then turns into a tRNA. The tRNA does its job and eventually turns into an mRNA.,1
225,12989,mRNA turns into tRNA and then its is turned into DNA which is turned into Proteins.,0
226,12990,The mRNA takes the RNA to the amino acid sequence so it can be made. The rRNA helps make the new RNA and then takes it to the tRNA. The tRNA then transfers it back to the nucleus where it is used.,0
227,12991,The DNA uncoils. The Rna becomes single stranded. The DNA is transformed. The DNA is rezipped.,0
228,12992,"they copy the DNA, they take it out of the nucleus, they make a new strand, and copy that",0
229,12993,After mRNA finishes it them goes to the tRNA and tells it who to copy the DNA while in the process Then comes the codons and come and take the copied DNA and separated.,0
230,12994,goes out the nucleus into the cell membrane into the ribosomes and out the cell wall,1
231,12995,"The mRNA will go through anaphase and then anaphase, then metaphase and finally telophase.",0
232,12996,mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes onto the ribosomes. The ribosomes then take the messenger RNA and transfer them. The ribosomes carry the mRNA to tRNA. The transfer RNA the goes into the DNA sequence. You go from mRNA to the ribosomes to tRNA and then to the final product.,1
233,12997,The mRNA finds a chain of codons in the nucleus to be taken out. Then the tRNA transfers this chain out of the nucleus. Then rRNA recodes the codons into the pattern of RNA and makes RNA with other proteins too.,0
234,12998,"The steps are transportation, Translation, Replication, & nutrition. They all help provide for the cell, giving it what it will need, and supplying for it.",0
235,12999,"First, the mRNA would carry the instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein into the cytoplasm. Second, the tRNA would receive these instructions, find the needed amino acids, and carry them to the ribosome. Third, the rRNA would bind amino acids with the codons to the ribosome. Fourth, the amino acids with the anticodons would be attached to the amino acids with the codons, which would result in a protein.",1
236,13000,The first step is transcription. The second step is ?The third step is translation. The fourth step is ?,0
237,13001,"it makes a copy strand, takes the copy strand out side of the nucleus, makes a copy of the amino acid, and multiplies.",0
