480,13245,mRNA will leave the nucleus carrying the coding for the protein from the DNA. It will place itself in the cytoplasm waiting for the matching amino acids to connect. The tRNA will bring the attracted amino acids to the mRNA and place them in the correct spot on the sequence. Then the enzyme will come and create the protein using the code that the amino acids made from mRNA.,1

486,13251,"First, mRNA receives a copy of the amino acid codon. Then the mRNA transfers that copy and reads the copy. It is then starting the process of making the protein. When the copy has been transferred and read and made, then the protein is made when the stop codon is passed and the process just keeps repeating after that.",1
487,13252,"mRNA will exit through the nucleus and travel to possible ribosomes that are nearby. tRNA will come with codons that will now attach themselves to the mRNA in a certain way. It first must seek the AUG which is the start codon. The rRNA will attach to the mRNA and create an area to where the codons can attach to the mRNA and create their own proteins. As proteins are forms, they are linked to form a polypeptide chain. This breaks down loose when reaching of a stop codon occurs.",3

513,13279,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, four major steps take place in order to complete protein synthesis.     The mRNA contains the codes for creating the proteins and thus goes to the ribosomes, which make proteins.       The ribosomes receive this information from the mRNA and translate the code into the type of protein that must be made.       This translated code provides the instructions for making the protein, and the ribosomes begin creating the protein.       Several proteins are made with specialized functions, depending on their code.",1

533,13299,new mRNA is made. The protein goes through a series of changes. It passes on data or mRNA. It gets data from other proteins.,0
534,13300,"The mRNA leaves the nucleus and then attaches to rRNA, ribosomal RNA. Once firmly attached to this ribosomal RNA, the mRNA forms codons, which are a set of three nucleotides. These codons then match with anticodons on tRNA, which also hold amino acids. The amino acids on the tRNA form peptide bonds with the other amino acids to form a chain. Once the bond between two proteins has been formed, the tRNA floats away to find another amino acid to carry. This process continues until there is a full chain of amino acids, which then creates a protein.",3

537,13303,"m-RNA leaves the nucleus. Then the m-RNA goes and gets a ribosome from Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum. It then takes the ribosome to the mitochondria and uses sugar, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide to produce a protein consisting of amino acids.",1
538,13304,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is sent to the ribosome. In the ribosome, the mRNA is read by the tRNA in a process called transcription. For every three base pairs, an amino acid is made. The tRNA continues to read the mRNA until a stop codon tells it to stop. All the amino acids are held together by peptide bonds. The finished product of amino acids is a protein.",2
539,13305,After the mRNA leaves it must brake down. Then after it breaks in halk those to halves have to make a new half. Then making those new halves you have two new protein strands.,0
