92,12854," The mRNA, after leaving the nucleus, then travels to the tRNA.  When the mRNA gets to the tRNA transcription happens and new codons are formed so as to match the mRNA's sequence.

110,12872,After mRNA leaves the nucleus it takes the information to the tRNA so it can transfer the information for the amino acid sequence. The next step is the tRNA makes the amino acid sequence.
