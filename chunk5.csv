245,13009,The mRNA copy the instructions from the DNA and come out of the nuclear envelope pores and travel to the ribosomes.

249,13013,when mRNA leaves the nucleus the process begins by interphase then prophase then metaphase then anaphase,0
250,13014,The mRNA is edited and the unwanted parts of the sequence are destroyed. Then translation occurs. The mRNA sequence is sent the  ribosome where rRNA is. The ribosome reads the mRNA by codons. The tRNA then brings an anticodon to attach to the mRNA. The chain of amino acids form a protein.,2
251,13015,"Step one would be mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the ribosome. Step two would be when the tRNA with a protein on top and a codon on bottom come and they attach the anticodons with the mRNA's anticodons. Step three would be after the tRNA attaches to the anticodons and leaves, it leaves behind an amino acid. Step four would be after several tRNA's come and go, and the amino acid's join together forming a polypeptide chain, which later becomes a protein",2

253,13017,interphase prophase anaphase telophase,0
254,13018,"Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to a ribosome. At the ribosome, initiation occurs when a tRNA molecule with the anti-codon UAC binds to the codon AUG, coding for the amino acid Met and starting the synthesis of the protein. Next, elongation occurs as more tRNA molecules bind to codons and form peptide bonds in between the amino acids to build the protein. When the tRNA comes upon a Stop codon, the new protein breaks off in the process of termination and goes into the cell. Last, the ribosome completes the process by disassembly, getting ready for a new mRNA molecule.",3

275,13039,"First they find their pair. Next, thymine replaces with uraine. Then they separate to make another pair. Finally they pair back together as a one pair.",0
276,13040,"When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters a ribosome. At the ribosome, translation starts to take place.  Anti-codons are paired with codons to make polypeptide sequences.  Codons consist of three of the following: adenine, uracil, cytosine, or guanine. They can go in any order such as AAA, UAU, GUU, CUA, and many  other combinations.  Complementary codons are like the opposite because they work in pairs. Adenine goes with uracil and Cytosine goes with guanine. Floating nucleotide bases are dropped off and put into order based on these complementary pairs.  Then amino acids are put into order as a polypeptide sequence.",2
277,13041,The mRNA leaves the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Next the mRNA goes to the ribosome. When the mRNA arrives at the ribosome the codons  sequence of three consecutive nitrogen bases are translated into amino acids. The amino acid chain is assembled and it then leaves the ribosome.,2
