After they divide the chromosomes begin to pull apart. This is all interphase. After they pull apart, 2 different cells begin to appear. This is call prophase. After they finish separating, 2 new cells are shown. This is call Interphase.",0
345,13109,mRNA sends out instructions to tRNA including what different amino acids are needed. The tRNA brings the amino acids together for synthesis. Then rRNA puts the amino acids together in the correct order and sequence. The body then uses the protein to perform a specific function.,1

352,13116,mRNA send a message to the proteins and tRNA transfers them,0
353,13117,"The process in which RNA makes proteins is called translation. During translation, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the ribosomes, the part of the cell that creates proteins. The tRNA pairs its anticodon with the mRNA's codon to form and amino acid. When another amino acid is made, the two pairs form a bond to stick together, holding information to create the protein. Once the stop codon arises and the bonds are complete, the protein is assembled.",3
354,13118,mRNA is changed to tRNA. tRNA is sent to Endoplasmic Reticulum. Protein is synthesized.,0

357,13121,"mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying the instructions on how to make a protein. Next, the tRNA takes that information to the rRNA, which starts the actual process of making the protein. Lastly, gRNA finishes out the job by sealing the protein and sending on its merry way to its final destination in the body.",0
358,13122,It goes though the ER in to a Vehicle then goes to the mitochondria and links up with the cells membrane eases out the cell,1
