543,13309,"Four steps of protein synthesis are the RNA leaving the nucleus, RNA splits, mRNA merges, tRNA comes and merges with the mRNA.",0
544,13310,"After leaving the nucleus mRNA begins to go through out the body and cause infections. Then the b bodies go into the body looking for the infection and then they trace down the z  bodies, once the z bodies are called down they travel throughout the body and once they find the infection the track it down and fight it off.",0
545,13311,Protein synthesis is the evolution and mutation of proteins in the body. The first major step of this process is when mRNA leaves the nucleus. The second step would be when the mitochondria begins to send out messages to begin the process. The DNA then sends out coding for the process as well. The final step is the completed product.,0

548,13314,"there is a start codon and tRNA carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequences, they are attached and translated",1
549,13315,It leaves the nucleus and then goes to the Golgi apparatus and then goes through a turbine like thing that turns it into protein.,0
550,13316,The four major steps are after the mRNA leaves it goes into the cytoplasm. Once it's in the cytoplasm it finds a tRNA strand and they combine together.,0
551,13317,  It replicates istelf  It starts to synthesize  Then it starts to change into protein  The final product you get is protein,0
552,13318,"transcription, replication, decryption, encryption",0
553,13319,"mRNA goes to different places. It gets different proteins. It acts as a messenger to different parts of the cell, then it leaves.",0
554,13320,transfer RNA it sends the mRNA to different parts of the bod y mRNA it sends messages to the cell floor also known as the cytoplasm,0
555,13321,the mRNA leaves the nucleus and takes the information it has to the tRNA which then translates the information to tell the cell what codon it needs to bring to complete the chain. Once that is done the tRNA sends the chain to be assembled. Once it is assembled the left over material is sent out of the cell to be disposed of.,1
556,13322,Protein synthesis can provide energy. It can help you gain weight and muscles. Finally it can help you when your older.,0
557,13323,First the DNA replicates. Then the DNA transcribes into RNA. Next the RNA replicates.,0
558,13324,mRNA tRNA rRNA RNA,0
559,13325,After mRNA leaves the nucleus it:           Gets split and goes through tRNA            Gets copied and attached again,0
560,13326,The cells are created then the cells divide     then they make more cells,0
561,13327,"four steps involved in protein synthesis is reproduction, mutation,",0
562,13328, The mRNA leaves the nucleus.  The mRNA turns to DNA so it is a stable chemical. I  now.  Then the DNA is stored for a long period of time.  Over time it is turned into Protein and that helps the cell.,0
563,13329,tRNA- transfers DNA,0
564,13330,"Metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and prophase.",0
565,13331,mRNA is copied into tRNA,0
566,13332,The mRNA leaves the  nucleus then goes to the cytoplasm where it gives its instructions to the rRNA. the rRNA reads those instructions and uses protein brought in by thru tRNA and assemble amino acids in the correct order.,2
567,13333,Anaphase combine Interphase move apart Metaphase Meet in the middle Prophase Divide into two,0
568,13334,"mRNA leaves the nucleus, and attaches to the ribosome. It then tells the ribosomes to make a sequence of nucleotides.",1
569,13335,first the proteins are gathered. next the proteins separate. then start to synthesize. if proteins don't move during process then they will be reproduced.,0
570,13336, The mRNA leaves the nucleus leaves the cell and goes to the ribosomes.    The mRNA is transcribed.  tRNA collects the amino acids and brings them bact to the ribosomes.   The ribosomes place together the amino acids into a single strand of protein.,1
571,13337,m RNA leaves the nucleus,0
572,13338,"The messenger RNA leaves the nucleus and brings the DNA to the cytoplasm. The DNA ladder unzips and the nucleotides are trying to find their matches. This is called transcription. RNA processing then occurs and the genetic code is given to the nucleus. Translation happens after the genetic code reaches the nucleus. During translation, the codons find their anti-codons in pairs of 3 to start making amino acids. After 20 amino acids, there will be a stop codon indicating the process to stop.",1
573,13339,"The mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then with the coiled DNA sequence, it matches up the corresponding amino acids. Then it goes to the ribosome and drops off the amino acids that match. I they don't match then they go back and try to do it again. When they do match it forms an amino acid and then it forms a protein.",1
574,13340,"In protein synthesis after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the cell will need to make a copy of the mRNA. After copying it, it will be synthase. Then, the copied version and the original version will be crossed over to cause genetic variation for the organism. Last, the cell will be sent out to the body to replace the ones that can no longer do their job efficiently.",0
575,13341,"Four major steps would be prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.",0
576,13342,The nucleus leaves the body.,0
577,13343,"when mRNA leaves the nucleus the ribosomes take it to the Golgi apparatus. Then, from there it goes to the mitochondria and then the nucleus",1
578,13344,anaphase prophase metaphase telophase,0
579,13345,The first step is the mRNA is unzipped by a RNA polymerase. Then it is made into tRNA. After that it enters our DNA and lastly it is made into protein.,0
580,13346,they are manufacture and produced and used then excreted from the nucleus,0
581,13347,Well after the RNA leaves the nucleus it makes a section strand that marches form the strand that it made to go with the DNA. It then turns in to TRNA witch turn the T bace in to a U bace and the U bace pears up with the A bace. Then they connect with the rRNA to make the amino acids .,0
582,13348,mRNA carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein.,0
583,13349,mRNA leaves the nucleus,0
584,13350,"mRNA leaves the nucleus first, second they get the ATP and they take it to the mitochondria and they let them know what they have to fix, fourth they go to the place where the cell needs fixed, and fifth they end up with protein synthesis.",0
585,13351,The mRNA leaves the nucleus. The mRNA takes a code to a ribosome. The amino acids in the ribosome translates the code and attaches a responds to the tRNA. The tRNA goes back to the nucleus with  its coded segments.,1
586,13352,mRNA enters the cytoplasm. It then carries instructions to the ammino acid sequence. Then it turns into tRNA and carries the complete sequence off. From there it creates a protein.,0
587,13355,"The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are when the DNA is being replicated, when rRNA is being produced, when tRNA is being produced and when mRNA is being changed.",0
588,13356,first you go to prophase then from prophase you go to metaphase from metaphase you go to anaphase from anaphase you go to telophase during all these steps you start off with two cell then you have the cells separating into two separate one then they just end as being one cell,0
589,13357,It gets rid of the nucleus.,0
