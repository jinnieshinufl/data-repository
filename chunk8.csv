The tRNA brings the correct codon to match with the mRNA.   Third, the codons attach and start to form a polypeptide chain.   Last, the tRNA will bring the last codon of the chain, called the stop codon.  This signals that the polypeptide chain is done forming, and then the chain will be released.",2

447,13212,When mRNA leaves the nucleus it goes through transcription where the mRNA is recopied into a new stand. The mRNA has now done its job and the tRNA takes over. The tRNA carries away the new strand of RNA to a new location where it is then used as needed.,0
448,13213,mRNA leaves the nucleus. Rna leaves instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein.,0
449,13214,"mRNA lives the nucleus, then it travels in the cytoplasm looking for a Ribosome. Ones it fiends the ribosome it goes in and rRNA takes control. rRNA puts the amino acids in the correct order. Then tRNA will bring the anticodons to finish making the protein.",1
450,13215,The second step is when the RNA is brought out to the ribosomes.  The third step is when the RNA is copied.  The RNA then is checked for mistakes.  Then finally the RNA gets sent out to deliver the 'message' to the cell.,0
451,13216,"In protein synthesis, step one is that mRNA uses the star codon to start reading the DNA strand. Second, it reads and makes a new strand. Third, it continuously adds one until it reaches the stop codon which is the fourth step.",1

469,13234,"The mRNA goes to a ribosome where it attaches to the P-site. tRNA match their anticodons to the respective codons of the portion of the mRNA strand in the P-site. After matching, the mRNA moves so that a new segment is in the P-site and the old segment is in the A-site. The amino acids connected to the tRNA that match up with the mRNA codons create peptide bonds and create a protein.",2
470,13235,"As the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it iks decoded into an amino acid. After that, the peptide bond between the stand of DNA starts to unravel. From there, a new strand is substituted in. The last step is when a peptide bond binds the strand back together and it is ready to be used.",1
471,13236,The mRNA travels to a ribosome. Translation occurs and tRNA attaches the anticodons to the mRNA that correspond with it. On the other end of the tRNA is the amino acid. The amino acids join together and detach from the tRNA and become a protein.,3
472,13237,it leaves and finds a host then it injects a die into it and it dies then the host produces more mRNA and then it leaves the nucleus again,0
