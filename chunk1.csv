1,12763, tRNA transfers it outside the nucleus to be matched with a ribosome  The ribosome latches on to an amino acid.  The codons match up  It creates protein.,1
2,12764,well in order to have that you  have to have a lot of strength and u 2 have to have a lot of nutrition in your body in order for all of that synthesis stuff to work because if you don't have any of that it wont work.,0
3,12765,mRNA will leave the nucleus with the information it received.  It will then go to the tRNA to show the amino acids.  The mRNA will then have codons to show which amino acids are needed and when to stop.,1

5,12767," When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it then goes to the transfer RNA to take the instructions for the  amino acids in the cell  After transfer RNA enters the cell, it gives the cell the needed amino acids  The amino acids are then synthesised  The cell then uses the amino acids for different uses",0
6,12768,mRNA leaves the nucleus RNA enters the nucleus Proteins are brought back into the nucleus mRNA re-enters the nucleus,0
7,12769,mRNA  leaves the nucleus  and  goes to tRNA  and the tRNA  is transferred to protein synthesis were it will evolve and the process will start over again.,0
8,12770, The mRNA arrives in the nucleus and goes through a ribosome.   In the ribosome the mRNA attracts a tRNA with the anticodon that matches its codon.  The tRNA brings the amino acid that matches the codon to the ribosome and attaches it to the other amino acids in the sequence.   Once the last codon is matched with its amino acid the tRNA work to form a polypeptide chain that will become a certain protein in the body based on its shape.,3

13,12775,It takes it into the cytoplasm where the tRNA comes and joins to gather with it for a little while then the tRNA leaves. The tRNA matches up with the matches to the mRNA and when they get together they make the protein that the body needs.,1
14,12776,After mRNA leaves the cell it Moved and put together by tRNA. Then it becomes rRNA and finally it turns into RNA.,0
15,12777,"feeding, absorbing the minerals, getting the nutrients, and passing them throughout the body",0
16,12778,"mRNA leaves the nucleus,",0
17,12779,The four major steps in protein synthesis are  The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to where the protein synthesis is to be a code for protein.  The proteins become synthesized by going through the code and receive their code for an amino acid.  The DNA is being divided into separate strands of DNA.  Each strand of DNA is coded and alike.,0
18,12780," The mRNA then goes into the ribosome to be transcript.   Other pieces of  rRNA are attached to the ribosome.  A specific enzyme is attached and starts to pair up the mRNA with other RNA to create a protein strip.   When this process is done, proteins have been formed, and are ready to perform their jobs.",1
19,12781,Four major steps involved in protein synthesis is...,0
20,12782,umm? first it goes through the one thing then through the other thing then back through the one thing again then finally it arrives in your body where it is needed,0
21,12783,the mRNA Finds a Ribosome. Enters it Connects with a anti-codon to make the amino acids form a chain of amino acids.,2
22,12784,tRNA will transfer it out.,0
23,12785,the first step is to search the place where they want to benumber 2 they break in to the piece number 3  finds where they want to fight number 4 they could die,0
24,12786,The mRNA takes the DNA to the tRNA to be made into two new strands of DNA. Which are made by two polymerase that go up and down the DNA molecule producing new segments of ionic bonds to the original ionic bonds. Then they are taken to the rRNA to become chromosomes.,0

27,12789,"First the mRNA leaves the nucleus, then it goes between a ribosome, then it transcribes into rRNA to create polypeptides  amino acids that will serve out there duty  to what they were made for.",1
28,12790,"RNA travels through the endoplasmic reticulum and to a ribosome, where codons translate the sequence of RNA, say, TAGA, to UAGA.",1

35,12797,It brings the protein back into the nucleus It helps the cell rebuild Proteins are distributed through the cell Proteins make body healthier,0
36,12798,eating healthy,0
37,12799,It goes to the mitochondria and then it follows the endoplasmic reticulum. It stops at the Golgi Apparatus where it is packaged and then it is sent out in a vesicle to other parts of the cell.,1
38,12800,Ribosomes and mitochondria both create proteins.,0
39,12801,"It has to make it to the mitochondria, then is goes to the membrane.",0
40,12802,mRNA leaves the nucleus tRNA transports the amino acids rRNA creates the proteins,0
41,12803,"The mRNA goes off to the rRNA stage to deliver the message of what the rRNA needs to code exactly. The rRNA then codes what the mRNA said to code, which of course then goes to the tRNA. The tRNA then brings the RNA strand to fuse with another RNA strand. Thus, the two strands become a DNA strand.",1
42,12804,"First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then, the mRNA travels and attaches itself to a ribosome. The mRNA then finds a codon that matches up with its correct codons. When they meet, they will form one section of DNA. The mRNA continue this process until the full strand of DNA is complete. Once complete, the mRNA will come to a stop codon, meaning that the process of protein synthesis is complete.",2
43,12805, mRNA leaves the nucleus  copy of the mRNA is made  chain the copies together  goes to another nucleus,0
44,12806,In protein synthesis messenger RNA leaves the nucleus and attaches onto a ribosome. Transfer RNA gets the information from the messenger RNA for the amino acid sequence. Transfer RNA transfers the information to the ribosomal RNA. Codons then start to attach to the mRNA and form an amino acid sequence.,1
45,12807,"The mRNA would then be transcribed by the tRNA during the process of replication.  This would then make the Ribose RNA which is sent the  Golgi Apparatus, packaged and sent out to the ribosomes in order to build that particular protein.",0
46,12808,"It goes through a pore, meets with transfer RNA, connects with a ribosome, and returns to the nucleus.",1
47,12809,metaphase- this splits the cells anaphase- this splits the cells into two telophase- this completes the split of the cells prophase- it is the first step,0
48,12810,THE FOUR MAJOR STEPS ARE  FIRST IT GIVES YOUR BODY THE NUTRIENTS AND THINGS IT NEEDS.  IT CLEANS YOUR BODY OUT.  THE PROTEIN STARTS TO FILTER EVERY THING OUT.  IT LEAVES YOUR BODY,0
49,12811, The mRNA goes down the electron transport chain.  It gains high energy electrons.  Exits the electron transport chain.  Passes the electrons to other parts of the cell.,0
50,12812,first you have mRNA then you have the development of the protein and next you have the life cycle of the protein then next you have the death of the protein.,0
51,12813,"mRNA will  find another mRNA, then they will be moved to a protein and combined. Then they will be sent to their destinations.",0
52,12814,"Starting with mRNA, the sequence then would start at its Duplication of DNA and then transferred into RNA by transcription. After the fact, it would then go on with translocation by converting it into mRNA, by then the mRNA is doing Replication by making more proteins and adding to the body.",0
53,12815, Is when it leaves it has to get use it being gone.2 Is they have to work to regain it back.3 Is when they are starting to regain it they have to store it.4 Is when they get it stored they have to make sure there is enough for everything.,0
54,12816,"it goes to the ribosome to make new copies, the tRNA copies the mRNA, then send it to wherever it needs to go.",1
55,12817,"When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is transcript into tRNA. Then it is translated and you get the amino acids. The amino acids then have their anticodons that are opposite of the codons for the amino acids.",0
56,12818,"Anaphase, which is where the nucleus and organelles disappear. Metaphase, where the DNA all lines up down the middle.  Telophase, where they split into two. Prophase.",0
57,12819,mRNA then travels through your body and the connects to your codons creating an amino acid which forms your DNA sequences. It then transfers into to tRNA and that then creates an amino acid which forms a codon which then forms our DNA.,0
