122,12885,First after mRNA leaves it is transferred to tRNA. Then tRNA transfers the information to the nucleus. The nucleus then carries out the action that needed to take place inside the cell. So it all starts with mRNA in order to get information to the nucleus for the function to be carried out.,0
123,12887,"The process starts out with the mRNA leaving the nucleus. The ribosomes in the cell are what makes the proteins. The mRNA attaches to a ribosome. The tRNA in the cell brings the materials needed to create protein to the mRNA. The tRNA can only get one material. Dehydration synthesis begins to join the parts together, making a protein.",1
124,12888,"The mRNA replicates the strand of DNA, making an exact copy of it. Then it leaves the nucleus and is cut into sections of three. Then, they are 'read.' These deciphered mRNA are then changed into amino acids. The amino acids make proteins.",1
125,12889," The translation process starts which decodes the mRNA message.2 Then the tRNA transfers that decoded message of the amino acid sequence.3 Next, the amino acid sequence goes through transcription.4 The protein is assembled on a ribosome.",1
126,12890," The mRNA created in the nucleus leaves the nuclear membrane and goes into the cytoplasm.   The mRNA is found by a ribosome. The two then lock in with one another.   tRNA brings anticodons to the ribosome. The organelle will read the anticodon and match it with the proper codon on the mRNA. This matchup causes a certain amino acid to form.   As this process continues through the entire length of the mRNA, a polypeptide is created.",2

130,12894,Starts of with the cell has to have an unwanted thing or damaged organelle inside of it. Then it has to have the lysosome come and eat these particles Then it starts to synthesis it. When it's done it gives off the energy to the rest of the cell.,0
131,12895,"After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosomes. It is a single strand, so tRNA comes with its codons that attach to the mRNA in specific ways. It first has to find AUG to start. The rRNA then attaches to the mRNA and creates the site to where the codons can attach to the mRNA and create proteins. As it creates the proteins, the proteins are linked to form a polypeptide chain. The polypeptide breaks loose when it reaches a stop codon.",3
132,12896,mRNA goes and gives the coded message to tRNA and tRNA then decodes the message goes and finds a protein and gives the protein the message and the protein is then made.,1

136,12900,"First, mRNA goes through transcription, translation, and something else I don't remember",0
137,12901,"DNA Coding: DNA is decode by the ribosome to make mRNA. Transcription: Once the DNA is coded into mRNA, the process of transcription follows in which the mRNA is recoded into tRNA anti-codons .Translation: Now the tRNA is then coded by the ribosome once again and is now ready for protein synthesis. Protein Synthesis: Following up on translation, the tRNA has now been coded and the new protein has been produced.",0
138,12902,"mRNA then turn into a ribosome, from their it gets the rest of the process happens with natural selection.",0
139,12903,"First, the mRNA binds with the tRNA. Second, the pairs of RNA that bind, bind with the amino acids. Third, they form a polypeptide. Lastly, the chain breaks lose.",1
140,12904,The mRNA takes instructions to the amino acid and then it the tRNA takes over there and it transfers the amino acid and the  whole sequence starts again.,0

142,12906,The mRNA binds to the ribosome and makes tRNA which then goes and gathers amino acids then the tRNA drops the amino acids off then goes and gets more until a 'stop' Condon is read then polypeptide bonds for making the protein then the protein leaves the cell.,3
143,12907,messenger- it leaves transcription- decodes RNA translation- Translates RNA ribosomal- Puts Rna into the correct ribosome,0
144,12908,mRNA goes to the ribosome were the ribosome creates tRNA and take it to a cell to be copied and translated into DNA,1
145,12909,"As mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to rRNA, or a ribosome, to be translated into a protein.  tRNA travels to the ribosome with an amino acid, it then creates a covalent bond and releases the amino acid.  As more and more of these covalent bond occur more amino acids begin to fuse together, creating a polypeptide bond.  The polypeptide then folds up and travels to the Golgi to be sent to where it is needed.",3
146,12910, It travels through the cytoplasm  It reaches the tRNA  tRNA codes for amino acids  The amino acids are sent,0
147,12911," The mRNA goes into a ribosome.  The rRNA translates the code in the ribosome.  The tRNA connects to amino acids  CG, AT .  When the tRNA reaches a stop codon a protein is released.",3
148,12912,"mRNA leaves the nucleus, and gives the amino acid sequence for the protein, the protein is made and used in a section of DNA",0
149,12913,The mRNA will go to a ribosome. The ribosome will make an opposite copy of the strand so it can fit together an have to similar RNA strands. The mRNA will go back to the nucleus to fit into the DNA. The RNA may have a mutation or the DNA strand will be complete.,1

151,12915, your body will push the proteins into your organs.  The proteins come from the organs and get moved into your digestive system.,0
152,12916, It goes to the amino acids to decode the message.  Gives the message to tRNA to transfers it to the ribosome.  The ribosome then understand the message and start making protein.  Protein is made.,0

158,12922,"The first step is when the mRNA attaches to the ribosomes, which are produced by rRNA. The mRNA forms a codon. Then, tRNA anticodons bring amino acids to match the codons. The amino acids attach by peptide bonds. After releasing the amino acid, the tRNA leaves to get more amino acids. The process stops when a complete protein is made.",2
159,12923,After mRNA leaves the nucleus it transcribes itself to make set of tRNA.,0
160,12924,After mRNA leaves transcription takes place in which the message from the mRNA is made into codons that code for amino acids.  Next translation occurs and the codons are translated  into anticodons.  Next the amino acids are brought in to create a protein.,1
161,12925,The nucleus will die out because it will not have no mRNA to help it survive. It will be able to create a new generation so that it can live on. It will struggle to live. It will not be able to collect food with out it.,0
