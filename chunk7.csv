375,13140,The mRNA leaves the nucleus and connects to tRNA in the ribosome.     The tRNA then makes an anticodon that matches the codons on the mRNA.     Then the tRNA goes out and finds the amino acid that matches with the anticodon that it's carrying.     Finally the all the tRNA come back and connect the amino acids in order to create the protein.,3

386,13151,"First, the tRNA bonds with the mRNA. The tRNA then gives anticodons that match the anticodons in the mRNA. This makes an amino acid. More tRNA then comes and repeats the whole process. The mRNA leaves the amino acid in the ribosome. This whole process is repeated until there is a stop codon. Then the chain of amino acids is released. This chain is a protein.",2

394,13159,"The 4 major steps are mRNA leaving the nucleus, then gets moved over to the ribosomes, then it gets put with the anticodons,  and the last part the proteins get formed into a chain type, resulting in protein synthesis.",1
395,13160,"After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it then shifts into tRNA which transports proteins across the cell. After the proteins had been transported, the process of RNA is shown, and it starts to build a RNA molecule.
